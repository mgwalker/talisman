# Talisman

Back in college (so, c. 2003-2005), [@WarDrummer](https://github.com/WarDrummer)
convinced me that we should try to create a video game clone of
[Talisman](https://www.games-workshop.com/talisman). So, we started on it. At
some point, we started over. `Talisman.OLD` is the first attempt, `Talisman` is
the second. Neither was ever finished. Not even close.

Preserved here because why not?
